# Sample Web App

A simple demo app that integrates with Betfair's OAuth2 flow, and gets the user's Betfair balance opn their behalf.

To run, enter your details in the config.properties file and run the main method in Application.java.

Two endpoints are available (when run locally):

- localhost:8080
- localhost:8080/publisher
